# Introduction 

This document will explore the following: 

1. Proportion of deaths that are NCDs
2. Top three NCDs 
3. Proportion of all NCD deaths due to these top three 
4. Differences by gender, SDI, age group

dta <- read_csv("data/ro1/big/sdi_subset.csv")
# want to link cause_ids to hierarchical classification

# 294 - all causes 
# 409 - NCDs
